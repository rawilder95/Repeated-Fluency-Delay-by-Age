        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        For this task, you will be given a category and asked to list as many
        items from that category as you can. For instance, if the category is
        instruments, you should list as many instruments as you can recall.
        <ul>
            <li> You will have three minutes to list as many items from the category as possible.
            <li> Please rely only on memory, and do not search the Internet for answers.
            <li>
                Do not enter the same item twice in a round, or list two items with the same suffix.<br>
                For example if you list "guitar", do not list "guitars" in the same round.
        </ul>
        You will be asked to do this two times in total.

        The next round will involve listing items again for a category.  This may or may not be a category you have already done.
        If it is a category you've already done, it's OK to list items you've
        listed before, but you may also list new items. Please try to list as
        many items as possible, but only list an item once per round.<br><br>

        Let's try that round again! Please use the entire allotted time to try
        and generate as many items as possible, listing each item once per round.

        The next round may or may not be a category you have already done.
        If it is a category you've already done, it's OK to list items you've
