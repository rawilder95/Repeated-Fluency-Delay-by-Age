# Repeated-Fluency-Delay-by-Age
Continuation of Thesis Fluency Task with the following changes: 
-Single category, 
-Immediate condition (5 min distractor) vs delayed condition (trial 1 done 24 hours before trial 2) 
	The immediate condition is found in the folder titled Immediate Condition
	The delayed condition is found in the folder titled Delayed Condition
	Both condition contain files with the same names but different code.  For example, the immediate condition contains code that propagates a distractor task between both fluency trials, whereas the delayed condition does not. 
	The Delayed condition is also a single-trial format, meaning that participants will complete a distinct single-trial fluency task twice 
	(method for subj ID management pending) 
-2 different age groups
